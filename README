NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::NextVersion::Sanitized - Sanitize versions
    handed to you by Git::NextVersion

VERSION
    version 0.002001

SYNOPSIS
    This exist, mostly because I accidentally keep doing

        V=2.6.0 dzil release # shit, I mean 2.006000

    Or

        V=2.00001 dzil release # Crap, I can't count, how many 0's is that?

    So this wraps "::Role::Version::Sanitize" around "[Git::NextVersion]"
