# NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::NextVersion::Sanitized - Sanitize versions handed to you by Git::NextVersion

# VERSION

version 0.002000

# SYNOPSIS

This exist, mostly because I accidentally keep doing

    V=2.6.0 dzil release # shit, I mean 2.006000

Or

    V=2.00001 dzil release # Crap, I can't count, how many 0's is that?

So this wraps [`::Role::Version::Sanitize`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Role::Version::Sanitize) around
[`[Git::NextVersion]`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::NextVersion)
